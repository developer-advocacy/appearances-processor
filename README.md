# joshlong.com/feed.html feed generator 

This captures information related to my public appearances and writes them out to a `.json` file so that they can be integrated into feeds, like on [joshlong.com/feed.html](https://joshlong.com/feed.html)

This script requires certain environment variables specific to this particular application. I've put those in a Lastpass folder called `joshlong.com` under the name `appearances-processor`.
